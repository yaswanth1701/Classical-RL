# Classical-RL
This repository contains all the tabular RL algorithms  from Monte-Carlo - Q Learning, most which are implemented on minigrid environment
#### This repo made to learn and implemented differet classical/tabular alogrithms taught by David Silver at deep mind
### General parameter and hyperparameters
- Episodes: all the alogrithms are initially ran for **150** episodes(this might be altered depending upon convergence of particular alogrithm)
- All alogrithms follow ε greedy policy. Except in case of Q learning base policy follows ε greedy policy and target policy follows greedy policy)

## Rewared vs episodes
### monte-carlo
### SARSA/SARSA-0
### SARSA-λ(Forward-view)
### SARSA(Backward-view)
### Q Learning
